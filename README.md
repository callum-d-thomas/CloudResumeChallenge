## Cloud Resume Challenge
This project is my attempt at the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) using Azure as the chosen cloud provider. It is a project that I intend to use to put into practice those skills picked up from the [AZ-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification) certification I have achieved through Microsoft and to help me prepare to sit the exam for the [AZ-204](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/?practice-assessment-type=certification) certification.

## Project Technology
